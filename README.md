# Hello

This is my first ever project in p5. All previous project were in Processing

### ~29/05/2024 Goals
-   [x] Relearn the basic structure of p5
-   [x] Embedded into an html to look like one page
-   [ ] Build cool simulation
-   [ ] Add interactive buttons to change/alter simulation

### If I come back to this
-   [ ] Documentation easy enough for a beginner to understand
-   [ ] Properly integrate TailwindCSS with npm for future use
    -   [ ] Might also be worth looking into loading p5 with npm
