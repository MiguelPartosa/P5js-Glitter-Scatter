# Hello 😁

    🚧 Ongoing Project 🚧

## Goal of this project

<div style = "text-align:center">
    <img src = "/preview.gif" width = 400 style="margin-left:center">

Using **P5JS** to make balls and scatter them around like they're a bunch of glitter/star objects

</div>

### Things I wish I learned sooner about p5

-   Calling `Background(red,blue,green,alpha < 255)` does not fully cover the background to make a _trailing effect_ even after multiple calls. It will leave a ghosting effect.
-   Using multiple p5js Files is as easy as adding `<script src="anotherScript.js"></script>` to the main html file.

### Short term Goals

-   [x] Relearn the basic structure of p5
-   [x] Embedded into an html to look like one page
-   [ ] ~~Mouse Click and drag feature to launch balls~~
-   [x] Ball trail and deleting the balls once their lifetime is over
-   [ ] ~~Ball physics~~
-   [ ] Obstacles or options to release multiple balls at once
-   [ ] Add interactive buttons to change/alter simulation

### If I come back to this

-   [ ] Shift from frame/draw dependance to something more reliable for consistent viewing accross different devices
-   [ ] Performance improvements where possible
